# Enhancing Energy Efficiency through Modification of Electrical Plans  
**Addressing Power Instability and Improving Power Consumption in SAL, LRAC, and T-Room Buildings at Cebu Institute of Technology – University (CIT-U)**  

---

## 📖 Project Description  
This repository contains electrical layouts, simulation data, and documentation for a study aimed at improving energy efficiency in three key buildings at CIT-U:  
- **SAL Building** (Science and Laboratory Building)  
- **LRAC Building** (Lecture Rooms and Classrooms)  
- **T-Room Building** (Technical and Workshop Rooms)  

The study focuses on:  
1. Identifying inefficiencies and power instability in existing electrical systems.  
2. Proposing modifications to electrical plans to optimize energy consumption.  
3. Validating solutions through simulations and real-world testing.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Electrical Layout Analysis**: AutoCAD diagrams of existing and modified electrical plans.  
- **Power Consumption Data**: Historical and simulated datasets for energy usage.  
- **Simulation Models**: ETAP/PowerWorld files for stability and load flow analysis.  
- **Proposed Solutions**: Recommendations for circuit redesign, renewable integration, and smart grid enhancements.  
- **Documentation**: Technical reports, cost-benefit analyses, and implementation guidelines.
